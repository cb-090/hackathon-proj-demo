# I Wish I Knew ... 
Created by Cara, Amelie, Milka, and Tara

We developed a web app using React, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and Supabase.  Our web app is a resource for young girls interested in going into STEM to help prepare them, and for older generations go give advice about things they wish they knew.  We have an about page, advice page, career page, and resource page.
