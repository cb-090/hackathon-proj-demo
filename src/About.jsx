        <p>Welcome to I Wish I Knew! ðŸ’–</p>
        <p>
          STEM can be awesome, but letâ€™s be realâ€”it can also be super confusing
          when youâ€™re trying to figure it all out on your own. Thatâ€™s why we
          created this journal-themed space just for you! Think of it as a
          big sister, bestie, and mentor all in oneâ€”packed with stories, advice,
          and things we wish we knew when we started our STEM journeys. Whether
          you're looking for guidance, motivation, or just a little reassurance
          that you belong (because you totally do!), this is your space to learn,
          share, and grow. So grab a virtual pen, dive in, and letâ€™s navigate STEM
          together! ðŸš€ðŸ’–
